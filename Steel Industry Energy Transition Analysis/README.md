## 🏷 Project Title
**Steel Industry Decarbonization & Energy Intensity Modeling (LEAP)**

---

## ✍️ Brief Summary
Analyzing energy demands and technology shifts in primary (Blast Furnace & DRI) and secondary (Electric Arc Furnace) steel production pathways under a mitigation scenario.

---

## 📌 Overview
This study models the energy consumption trends and technological shift scenarios within the steel sector using LEAP. The goal is to estimate and visualize the energy transition path from fossil-heavy production to a low-carbon steelmaking process.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
The steel industry is a major energy consumer and CO₂ emitter. Transitioning from conventional blast furnaces to low-carbon Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) and Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF) is critical for climate goals.

---

## 🧾 Scenario Description
- Steel production in Freedonia is modeled from 2014 to 2050.
- Includes both **primary** (Blast Furnace, DRI) and **secondary** (EAF) routes.
- Models growth (4% annually) and increasing share of EAF (up to 50% by 2050).
- Forecasts fuel shift from coal to hydrogen in DRI by 2050.

---

## 📌 Key Observations
- A rapid decline in coal usage is projected in both BF and DRI technologies.
- Hydrogen replaces coal as the main fuel for DRI by 2050.
- Secondary production using EAF becomes more significant, aligning with mitigation goals.
- Overall energy demand in the steel sector is significantly reduced by mid-century.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The LEAP-based analysis illustrates how sector-wide energy shifts, particularly the integration of hydrogen and increased EAF share, can reduce final energy demand in the steel industry by 2050. This project supports deeper analysis for low-carbon industrial transition planning.
